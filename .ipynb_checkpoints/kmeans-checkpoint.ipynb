In short terms, the algorithm, wants to place each cluster, and assign each point to a cluster, in a way that the sum of distances of every datapoint to their corresponding cluster centers is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cost function, cannot be optimized in polynomial time, so we use an algorithm which consists of two steps:\n",
    "1. by fixing the centers, we assign each datapoint to the closest center.\n",
    "2. by fixing the datapoint assignments, we determine the center of each cluster by averaging the datapoints assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method does not guarantee that the cost function reaches its global minimum, However, it is easy to show that in each step the cost function decreases (if it has not yet reached a local minima).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The silhouette method:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, for each datapoint $d$ we calculate a score called the silhouette score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s(d) = \\frac{b(d) - a(d)}{max(b(d), a(d))}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation, $a(d)$ is equal to the average distance of datapoint $d$ to the datapoints in the same cluster which $d$ is in; and $b(d)$ is equal to minimum of the average distances of $d$ to datapoints in each of the clusters which $d$ is not in.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily observe that the silhouette score is between -1 and 1. 1 shows that $d$ is compact within its cluster and far away from the other clusters which is good. and -1 shows that $d$ is actually close to the datapoints from other clusters and far from datapoints in the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "averaging the silhouette score, gives us a measure of how good a clustering is and using that, we can determine the best k.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Distortion measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method we calculate a measure called __distortion__ to determine how good a clustering is. The distortion measure is calculated using the following equation:\n",
    "$$D(X, M) = \\sum_k{\\frac{1}{C_k}\\sum_n{r^k_n||m_k - x_n||^2}}$$\n",
    "in which $C_k$ is the number of datapoints in cluster $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can understand, this is simply the sum of average of distance of datapoints to their corresponding  cluster centers for each cluster. Obviously the lower the distortion measure is, the better the clustering is.\n",

    "We have implemented this method in the Kmeans class in \"calc_distortion\" function.\n",
